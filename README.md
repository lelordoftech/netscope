# Netscope CNN Analyzer

Available here: https://lelordoftech.github.io/netscope 

This is a CNN Analyzer tool, based on Netscope by [dgschwend](https://github.com/dgschwend).
Netscope is a web-based tool for visualizing neural network topologies. It currently supports UC Berkeley's [Caffe framework](https://github.com/bvlc/caffe).

This fork adds analysis capabilities, enabling the computation of network complexity (number of operations) and network size (number of parameters) for easy comparison of different networks.
